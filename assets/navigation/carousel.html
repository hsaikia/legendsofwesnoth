<p>Legends of Wesnoth (LoW) is based on Trueskill - the Bayesian ranking method which lets you approach your "true skill" with just a few games. Furthermore, LoW showcases the scalability aspects of Trueskill and becomes the first system to introduce a separate 2 v 2 ladder! So go ahead and report your Loris River victories!</p>
